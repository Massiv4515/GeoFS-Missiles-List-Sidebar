# GeoFS Military Roleplay Missile List

This project adds a **missile list panel** on the right side of the GeoFS flight simulator page.  
It is designed to help **new** players in **military roleplay** quickly access missile names (Chaffs & Flares) during combat, without wasting time scrolling or searching.
